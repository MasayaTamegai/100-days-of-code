# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 ### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got through 23 challenges on the Basic JavaScript section of freecodecamp.com.

**Thoughts:** Doing the math parts got me really confused.  Although, I noticed that I'm usually right with the answers but I second guess myself a lot.

 ### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got 12 in. I completely got stopped on the Escape Sequences in Strings challenge.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and it put me to sleep.  So, I got up and showered,  sat down and tried it again.  Still couldn't figure it out so I just googled it.  Figured out the needed code and breezed through the next ten challenges.

**Thoughts**: I hear that most coders don't have everything memorized and that Googling answers is ok... right? Well,  I've been at this coding for almost 2 years now and I feel like I'm trying all kinds of ways to approach coding.  Up until recently I never gave Google too much use but now that I'm in that rhythm I hope I can start to get the hang of it.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got 16 in.   

**Thoughts**: Much easier today... or tonight than it was yesterday.  I didn't get too stuck for too long.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much progess today... only 2 challenges.   

**Thoughts**: GEE WHIZ! Some of these challenges just make my brain bleed or something by thinking so hard.  https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/stand-in-line This challenge for some reason is not letting me through.  I think I have an idea of how to go about it but I feel like I'm missing a vital peice of info.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have better luck or maybe I can just brush up on my HTML and CSS and make some interests pages.
